# Overview and Class Goals

<!-- Begin from Chris Adolph syllabus -->

This course continues the graduate sequence in quantitative political methodology, focused particularly on fitting, interpreting, and refining the linear regression model.

Our agenda includes gaining familiarity with statistical programming via the popular R environment, developing clear and informative graphical representations of regression results, and understanding regression models in matrix form.

<!-- End from Chris Adolph syllabus -->

# Prerequisites

<!-- Begin from Chris Adolph syllabus -->

It is desirable for students to have taken the introductory course in the
sequence (Political Science 501), but any prior course on basic social statistics and linear
regression should suffice.

<!-- End from Chris Adolph syllabus -->

# Course Requirements

<!-- Begin from Chris Adolph syllabus -->

Course evaluation will be based on problem sets (given weekly or
biweekly) and a final paper (due TBD). You may discuss the problem sets with other students (and should note any such collaborators on your write-up), but the computer code, results, and write-up must be your own. The final paper should be a 15--20 page report on an original quantitative analysis or replication-and-extension
of a published article.
Students may work in pairs on the final paper with instructor permission.
