# R Getting Help

*TODO: whittle this down*

- Learn to use the help commands: `?`, `help`, `apropos`
- Someone's probably asked your question on Stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r. So search and find the answer. But you are unlikely to have questions (yet) that haven't been asked and answered here, so avoid asking questions until you're more proficient.
- Google has gotten better with R searches, but `R` (like other one-letter language names) is a particularly unfriendly search term
- [rseek.org](http://rseek.org) is a specialized search restricted to sites already known to be related to R the statistical programming language
- Other people asking how to learn R
    - http://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-R
	- UCLA ATS list http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/

- [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net/)
- Cookbook for R [graphs](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/) The author now works for Rstudio, infer from that what you will.
- [R Studio Cheatsheets](http://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) has several cheat sheet

    - [Data Wrangling](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)
	- [R Markdown Cheat Sheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)
	- [R Markdown Reference Guide](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf](http://www.rstudio.com/wp)

- The ggplot2 documentation is itself almost a cheatsheet: http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/.
- Jared Lander, [R for Everyone](http://www.amazon.com/Everyone-Advanced-Analytics-Graphics-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321888030) Teaches R assuming neither a programming or statistics background. One that I have considered and may consider in the future.
- Note that all books in the Springer UseR! Series are available as eBooks (the non-DRM downloadable pdf kind!) from the UW Library.

    - Peter Daalgard, *Introductory Statistics with R*
	- Robert Muenchen, *R for Stata Users*
	- Hadley Wickham, *ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis*. It's a litte out of date at this point, so trust the `ggplot2` documentation. But, a new version is coming out any day now.
	- Venables and Ripley, *Modern Applied Statistics with S*. A good reference book for both a variety of statistical models and how to implement them in R. 
- Some people explaining why it is hard to learn R (although I think it has gotten much better!)

    - http://r4stats.com/articles/why-r-is-hard-to-learn/
	- http://www.statmethods.net/about/learningcurve.html

- Need to level up your R skills?

    - Hadley Wickham, *Advanced R*. If you really want to know what R as a *language* is doing, this is now the place to start. Available free as in beer and freedom at http://adv-r.had.co.nz/, and as a physical copy published by [CRC](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1466586966/).
	- Hadley Wickham, *R packages*. If you want to write your own R package (and you should), start here. Available for free at http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/.
	- Norman Matloff, [The Art of R Programming](http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Programming-Statistical-Software/dp/1593273843)
	- Garrett Grolemund, *Hands-On Programming with R*, http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028574.do
    - Like Dante? Frustrated with R? [The R Inferno](http://www.burns-stat.com/documents/books/the-r-inferno/)

- Yihui Xie, *Dynamic Documents with R and knitr* http://www.amazon.com/Dynamic-Documents-knitr-Chapman-Series. The book about *knitr* from the author of *knitr*.
- An (almost) comprehensive bibliography of R books http://www.r-project.org/doc/bib/R-books.html. They leave out some of the books widely disliked in the R community or obsolete.
- Don't Bother

    - [R in a Nutshell](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596801717.do) Not for learning R. Okay as reference.
    - John Verzani, *Using R for Introductory Statistics*. This (formerly) appeared on many an stats syllabi (It's what I used in my equivalent of 503), and is decent, but the R code is poor and now woefully out of date.
	- Michael Crawley, *The R Book*. No, it's not. Don't bother.

# LaTeX

- Need to lookup a LaTeX symbol? Just draw it here: http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html
- Heres a couple of online LaTeX math equation editors: http://www.sciweavers.org/free-online-latex-equation-editor, http://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php They seem fine, but a good LaTeX friendly text editor will have better capabilities
