Your answers may (and likely will) diverge on the model selection question using the Ross data.
Model selection is not an easy problem, and in research, there is not simple algorithm to find the "best" model.
In part, this is because the "best" model is contingent on your purposes.
Generally what you are looking for while exploring the space of models is how sensitive your results are to model specification.
If they are robust to a variety of specifications, that is a good sign.
If they are sensitive to the particular specification, it could be the case that the result was spurious, or you need to bring other data or theory to the problem to understand why one particular specification should be preferred to the others.
