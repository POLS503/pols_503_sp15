Before you turn it in, some reminders regarding Problem Set 3:

1. You need to answer the problems with natural language --- i.e. what humans use --- in addition to code.
   Explain what your answer is and how the code you ran supports your conclusion.
2. Format your problem set so it is clear and easy to read. Clearly separate the problems, and parts of problems.
   If you follow the template, this should not be much of an issue.
3. Show code, but do not show any more than is necessary. Remove extraneous messages, and print no more output than is necessary to support your claims.
   Anything else only creates confusion confusion.
