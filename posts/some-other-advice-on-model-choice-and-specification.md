I uploaded the chapter "Specification" from Peter Kennedy, *A Guide to Econometrics*, to [canvas](https://canvas.uw.edu/files/31651043).
It has some good and honest advice about choosing specification of models; the text itself is a little dated, but the general advice and intuition is ageless.
I suggest you read through it.
This is a text that I used back when I first learned linear models, and I've only grown to appreciate it more as time has gone it.
