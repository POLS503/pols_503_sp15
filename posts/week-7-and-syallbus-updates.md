I posted lecture notes from this week, after cleaning them up based off of the mistakes I noticed, and what we actually talked about in class.
One topic we did not cover was outliers and robust regression methods.
I encourage you to look at Chris Adolph's lecture [notes](http://faculty.washington.edu/cadolph/503/topic6.pw.pdf) on this.

I have adjusted the syllabus yet again.
Next week we will cover regression interpretation, model selection and the bootstrap.
Please read the articles that were assigned: King et. al, Schrodt, and Achen.
