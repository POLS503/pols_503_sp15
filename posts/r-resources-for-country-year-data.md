If you are using country year data, here are a few R packages that you may find useful:
- [psData](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psData/index.html) A package to download regularly maintained political science data setsand make commonly usedbut infrequently updated variables based on thisdata.
- [countrycode](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/countrycode/index.html) convert country names and codes.
- [Quandl](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Quandl/index.html) Financial, economic, and social datasets from various countries
- [WDI](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WDI/index.html) Interface for the World Developement Indicators

In general, you can find some good government data related R resources among the [rOpenGov](http://ropengov.github.io/projects/) projects.  The [Web Technologies](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/WebTechnologies.html) CRAN task view links to many R packages that help getting data.
