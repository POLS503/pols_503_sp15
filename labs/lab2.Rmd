We will be using the following libraries in this `dplyr` and `ggplot2` so make sure to install and load those libraries:

```{r, libraries, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library("dplyr")
library("ggplot2")
library("gapminder")
```

## Missing Data

Misssing data is particularly important

```{r}
foo <- c(1, 2, NA, 3, 4)
```


**Challenge**

- What is the result of `mean(foo)`
- Look at the documentation of `mean` to change how that function handles missing values.
- How does `median(foo)` work? 
- `foo > 2`. Are all the entries `TRUE` and `FALSE`?
- What does `is.na(foo)` do? What about `! is.na(foo)` ?
- What does `foo[is.na(foo)]` do?

The function `na.omit` is particularly useful.
It removes any row in a dataset with a missing value in *any* column.
For example,
```{r}
dfrm <- data.frame(x = c(NA, 2, NA, 4), y = c(NA, NA, 7, 8))
na.omit(dfrm)
```


# Gapminder Data

You will be using the gapminder data again.
In the first lab, you loaded the data from a csv file to show how to load from a csv.
In this lab, you will be using the same data, but as it is distributed in **gapminder** package.

To load a dataset included with an R package, use the `data()` function.
You can see which datasets are included in a package,
```{r}
data(package = "gapminder")
```


**challenge** 

- Which dataset in the **gapminder** package is country data?
- Load that data using the `data` function
- Pull up the help page for the "gapminder" dataset

Load the gapminder data
```{r}
data("gapminder")
```

# Introduction `dplyr`

**dplyr** is a package for data manipulation.
It provides a few core functions data manipulation. 
Most data manipulations can be done by combining these verbs together --- something which becomes even easier with the `%>%` operator.

-  `filter()`: subset observations by logical conditions
-  `slice()`: subset observations by row numbers
-  `arrange()`: sort the data by variables
-  `select()`: select a subset of variables
-  `rename()`: rename variables
-  `distinct()`: keep only distict rows
-  `mutate()` and `transmute()`: adds new variables
-  `group_by()`: group the data according to variables
-  `summarise()`: summarize multiple values into a single value
-  `sample_n()` and `sample_frac()`: select a random sample of rows

**dplyr** also offers the function `glimpse` to quickly view the data
```{r}
glimpse(gapminder)
```
or `tbl_df` - which will offer a more [^2]

## Exploring our Data

We are ready to begin exploring our data set in more depth.

We want to explore the relationship between life expectancy and GDP.
Let's use some `dplyr` verbs to explore our data.
For you Stata users missing "if statements" let's begin with `filter()`

```{r}
filter(gapminder, lifeExp < 29)
filter(gapminder, country == "Rwanda")
filter(gapminder, country %in% c("Rwanda", "Afghanistan"))
```

## %>%

Before we go any further, we should exploit the new pipe operator that `dplyr` imports from the **magrittr** package. 
This is going to change your data analytical life.


## Use `select()` to subset the data on variables or columns.

Most of the times we don't need to see all the variables and are often interested in just a few of them. Here’s a conventional call:
```{r results='hide'}
select(gapminder, year, lifeExp)
```

**Challenge**

Using a combination of `filter`, `select` and and `slice` show only year and life expectancy of Cambodia for the first two observations

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "Cambodia") %>%
  select(year, lifeExp) %>%
  slice(1:2)
  
```

**Challenge** Use `mutate()` to add  new variables

Imagine we wanted to recover each country’s GDP. We do have data for population and GDP per capita. what do we do?

-  Yes we multiply, let's create a new variable called GDP that brings back the gross amount

```{r}
gapminder <- gapminder %>%
mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap)

gapminder %>% glimpse #let's take a look
```

So... GDP is almost useless because it doesn't give a base line and that is why we often use per capita, but a baseline is often more useful, how about comparing it to another country sat, USA? Yes USA, USA, USA!

Let's  create first an object containing only US data, we use `filter` here
```{r}
just_usa <- gapminder %>% filter(country == "United States")

```

Remember our friend `match` from that 501 R homework, Yeah I don't remember either... Well, here it is again!
```{r}
gapminder <- gapminder %>%
  mutate(usa = just_usa$gdpPercap[match(year, just_usa$year)],
         gdpPercapRel = gdpPercap / usa)

gapminder

gapminder %>%
  select(gdpPercapRel) %>%
  summary
```

Nice, now we can do something like this:

Look at the GDP per capita  of Mexico and Canada relative to US by year
```{r}
gapminder %>%filter(country==c("United States", "Canada", "Mexico")) %>%
  select(country, year, gdpPercap, usa, gdpPercapRel)
```

Great! Mexico is way poorer in relation to US.


### `arrange`

Because the world is not always ordered the way we want it
```{r}
gapminder %>%
  arrange(year, country)


gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  arrange(lifeExp)

```


** Challenge

What about life expectancy? Create a relative to life expectancy variable, compare the three NAFTA countries US, Canada and Mexico

WOW! Mexicans are relatively poor but not dying, Great!

# Plotting with ggplot2

We will be using the graphics package **ggplot2**, which is one of the most popular, but it is only one of several graphics packages in R.[^1]


## Grammar of graphics

Unlike many other graphics systems, functions in **ggplot2** do not correspond to separate types of graphs.
There are not scatterplot, histogram, or line chart functions per se.
Instead plots are built up from component functions.

1. Data
2. Aesthetics: Maps variables in the data to visual properties: position, color, size, shape, line type ...
3. Geometric objects: The specific shapes that are drawn: points, lines, 
4. scales: How variables values map to "computer" values.
5. stat: summarize or transform the data. e.g. bin data and count in histogram; run a regression to get a line.
5. facet: create mini-plots of data subsets

Let's continue using the gapminder data, take another look at it
```{r}
glimpse(gapminder)
```

Great, let the plotting begin:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))
```
This gives an error message because there is nothing to plot yet!

This just initializes the plot object, it is better if you assign it to an object, `p` is good enough
```{r}
p <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))
```

No we can add `geoms`
```{r}
p + geom_point()
```


That look okay but it would probably look be better if we log transform
```{r}
p_l <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = log10(gdpPercap), y = lifeExp))
p_l + geom_point()
```

A better way to log transform
```{r}

p + geom_point() + scale_x_log10()

```

Let's make that stick
```{r}
p <- p + scale_x_log10()

```

Common workflow: gradually build up the plot you want,  re-define the object 'p' as you develop "keeper" commands.
Note that in the reassigning we excluded the `geom`.


Now, let continent variable to aesthetic color
```{r}
p + geom_point(aes(color = continent))

```

In full detail, up to now:
```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_point() + scale_x_log10()
```

Let's address over-plotting: SET alpha transparency and size to a value
```{r}
p + geom_point(alpha = (1/3), size = 3)

```

Add now a fitted curve or line
```{r}
p + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
p + geom_point() + geom_smooth(lwd = 2, se = FALSE)

p +  geom_smooth(lwd = 1, se = FALSE, method = "lm") + geom_point()

```
That's great but i actually think want revive our interest in continents!
```{r}

p + aes(color = continent) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(lwd = 3, se = FALSE)
```
Facetting: another way to exploit a factor
```{r}
p + geom_point(alpha = (1/3), size = 3) + facet_wrap(~ continent)

# Still want lines? Let's add them
p + geom_point(alpha = (1/3), size = 3) + facet_wrap(~ continent) +
  geom_smooth(lwd = 2, se = FALSE)
```

**Challenge**

* plot lifeExp against year
* make mini-plots, split out by continent
* add a fitted smooth and/or linear regression, w/ or w/o faceting

## Saving plots

You can use the `ggsave` function to save plots.


```{r}
## CHALLENGE HERE


# plot lifeExp against year
# y <- ggplot(gDat, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point()

# make mini-plots, split out by continent
# y + facet_wrap(~ continent)

# add a fitted smooth and/or linear regression, w/ or w/o facetting
#y + geom_smooth(se = FALSE, lwd = 2) +
#  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method ="lm", color = "orange", lwd = 2)

# y + geom_smooth(se = FALSE, lwd = 2) +
#  facet_wrap(~ continent)

```

What if I am only interrested in the US?

sadly, ggplot() does not have a 'subset =' argument
so do that 'on the fly' with subset(..., subset = ...)

```{r}
ggplot(subset(gapminder, country == "United States"),
       aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) + geom_line() + geom_point()

```

Let just look at five countries

```{r}
jCountries <- c("United States", "Canada", "Rwanda", "Cambodia", "Mexico")
ggplot(subset(gapminder, country %in% jCountries),
       aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = country)) + geom_line() + geom_point()
```


So what's up with Mexico?

* Nafta? Higher GDP?

Not really...
```{r}
Countries <- c("United States", "Canada", "Rwanda", "Cambodia", "Mexico")
ggplot(subset(gapminder, country %in% jCountries),
       aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = country)) + geom_line() + geom_point(aes(size=gdpPercap))
```
