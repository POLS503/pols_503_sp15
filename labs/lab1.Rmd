# RStudio

R is the name of the programming language, and RStudio is a convenient and widely used interface to that language.

Since you will be using it for the remainder of the course, you should familiarize yourself with the RStudio GUI.

![RStudio GUI](./images/RStudio.png)

It consists of four windows,

1. Bottom left: The **console** window. You type commands at the ``>`` prompt and R executes them.
2. Top left: The **editor** window. Here you can edit and save R scripts which contain multiple R commands.
    - You can open a new R script using *File -> New -> R script*.
    - If you highlight an area, you can run those commands in the console with the "Run" button.
    - You can run all the commands in the **editor** window using the "Source" button.
3. Top right
    - **workspace** lists all R objects (variables) that are defined
    - **history** lists all the commands that have been typed into the console.
4. Bottom right

    - **files** allows you to browse directories and open files.
    - **plots** displays any plots created. In this window you can toggle back through previously created plots.
    - **packages** shows which packages are installed and loaded.
    - **help** displays R help.

RStudio documentation can be found at <http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/>.
Of those, the most likely to be useful to you are:

- [Working in the Console](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/using/console)
- [Editing and Executing Code](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/using/source)
- [Viewing Command History](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/using/history)

# Installing and Loading Packages

One of the best features of R is that, at the time of writing, there are over 6,000 packages which add functions and data to R.
The current list of packages is can be found on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/), the R project's homepage.

You will use several packages in this course, so you will need to know how to install them.
Using a package requires two steps.

1. installing
2. loading

These two steps are analogous to downloading/installing a program and opening/executing a program, respectively.
Installing the package downloads the code onto your computer so that R can make use of it.
Loading a package makes the functionality contained in the package available to your current R session.
You only need to to install the package once, although if new versions of the package become available, you may need to update or reinstall the package.

Let's install some packages that we will be using in this course.

```{r}
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr"))
```

The code above installed three packages, **dplyr**, **ggplot2**, and **tidyr**.
The `c()` is used to "combine" the package names into a single character vector.

# Using R as a calculator

Although it is so much more, you can use R as a calculator.
For example, to add, subtract, multiply or divide:
```{r }
2 + 3
2 - 3
2 * 3
2 / 3
```

The power of a number is calculated with ``^``, e.g. $4^2$ is,

```{r }
4 ^ 2
```

R includes many functions for standard math functions.
For example, the square root function is ``sqrt``, e.g. $\sqrt{2}$,

```{r }
sqrt(2)
```

And you can combine many of them together
```{r}
(2 * 4 + 3 ) / 10
sqrt(2 * 2)
```

# Variables and Assignment

In R, you can save the results of calculations into objects that you can use later.
This is done using the special symbol, ``<-``.
For example, this saves the results of 2 + 2 to an object named ``foo``.
```{r}
foo <- 2 + 2
```
You can see that ``foo`` is equal to ``4``
```{r}
foo
```
And you can reuse foo in other calculations,
```{r}
foo + 3
foo / 2 * 8 + foo
```

foo / 2 * 8 + foo
```

**Note:** You can also use 

# Data and Data Frames

*Data frames* in R correspond to what you usually think of as a dataset or a spreadsheet, rows are observations and columns are variables.

Use the `gapminder` data.

# R Scripts

You can save R commands in a file called an R script. 
To create a new R Script use *File -> New File -> R Script*.
This will create a new tab in the upper left panel which will have a name like "Untitled1".
Save this to a file with the extension ".R" (RStudio will warn you if you do not)

To see how this works, write a few commands in the editor.
For example,
```{r}
2 + 2
3 + 8
mean(c(1, 2, 3))
```
You can run the current line or highlighted section with *Ctl-Enter* or the *Run* button. 
You can run the *entire* script with *Ctl-Shift-S* or the *Source* button.

# Comments

Any R code following a hash (``#``) is not executed.
These are called comments, and can be used to annotate and explain your code.
For example, this doesn't do anything.
```{r }
# hello, world!
```
And in this, nothing after the ``#`` is executed,
```{r }
2 + 2 # hello, world!
```
Although you can put comments on the same line after code, it is good practice to put comments on separate lines

# Creating your first R Markdown Document

- Create a markdown document
- This should have a pretty graph
- Save it to html and doc. Saving to pdf would require instal

# RSTudio Projects

I like how STAT545 introduces it https://stat545-ubc.github.io/block002_hello-r-workspace-wd-project.html

# Introduction to ggplot2

- Either the vignette for ggplot2 or Kathrik Ram's tutorial (http://inundata.org/2013/04/10/a-quick-introduction-to-ggplot2/; referenced in Software Carpentry) look as good a place to start as any.
