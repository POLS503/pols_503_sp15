# Learning Objectives

1. Install R and Rstudio
2. 
3. Find help

# Installing R

Install R, Rstudio and **devtools**. Follow the instructions [here](http://pols503.github.io/pols_503_sp15/getting_help_with_r.html).

# Orientation with RStudio

R is the name of the programming language, and RStudio is a convenient and widely used interface to that language.

Since you will be using it for the remainder of the course, you should familiarize yourself with the RStudio GUI.

![RStudio GUI](./images/RStudio.png)

It consists of four windows,

1. Bottom left: The **console** window. You type commands at the ``>`` prompt and R executes them.
2. Top left: The **editor** window. Here you can edit and save R scripts which contain multiple R commands.
    - You can open a new R script using *File -> New -> R script*.
    - If you highlight an area, you can run those commands in the console with the "Run" button.
    - You can run all the commands in the **editor** window using the "Source" button.
3. Top right
    - **workspace** lists all R objects (variables) that are defined
    - **history** lists all the commands that have been typed into the console.
4. Bottom right

    - **files** allows you to browse directories and open files.
    - **plots** displays any plots created. In this window you can toggle back through previously created plots.
    - **packages** shows which packages are installed and loaded.
    - **help** displays R help.

RStudio documentation can be found at <http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/>.
Of those, the most likely to be useful to you are:

- [Working in the Console](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/using/console)
- [Editing and Executing Code](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/using/source)
- [Viewing Command History](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/using/history)


Go to *Tools > Global Options*. Change the font and color of the editor and console. Which one do you like the best? 

# Using R as a calculator

Although it is so much more, you can use R as a calculator.
For example, to add, subtract, multiply or divide:
```{r }
2 + 3
2 - 3
2 * 3
2 / 3
```

The power of a number is calculated with ``^``, e.g. $4^2$ is,

```{r }
4 ^ 2
```

R includes many functions for standard math functions.
For example, the square root function is ``sqrt``, e.g. $\sqrt{2}$,

```{r }
sqrt(2)
```

And you can combine many of them together
```{r}
(2 * 4 + 3 ) / 10
sqrt(2 * 2)
```

# Variables and Assignment

In R, you can save the results of calculations into objects that you can use later.
This is done using the special symbol, ``<-``.
For example, this saves the results of 2 + 2 to an object named ``foo`` [^1]
```{r}
foo <- 2 + 2
```
You can see that ``foo`` is equal to ``4``
```{r}
foo
```
And you can reuse foo in other calculations,
```{r}
foo + 3
foo / 2 * 8 + foo
```

[^1]: If you are curious as to why the variable was named `foo`, read [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar).

You can use `=` instead of `<-` for assignment.
You may see this in some other code.
There are some technical reasons to use `<-` instead of `=`, but the primary reason we will use `<-` instead of `=` is that this is the convention used in modern `R` programs.

Create a variable named whatever strikes your fancy and set it equal to the square root of 2.
Then multiply it by 4.


# Data and Data Frames

*Data frames* in R correspond to what you usually think of as a dataset or a spreadsheet, rows are observations and columns are variables.

Use the `gapminder` data.


# R Scripts

You can save R commands in a file called an R script. 
To create a new R Script use *File -> New File -> R Script*.
This will create a new tab in the upper left panel which will have a name like "Untitled1".
Save this to a file with the extension ".R" (RStudio will warn you if you do not)

To see how this works, write a few commands in the editor.
For example,
```{r}
2 + 2
3 + 8
mean(c(1, 2, 3))
```
You can run the current line or highlighted section with *Ctl-Enter* or the *Run* button. 
You can run the *entire* script with *Ctl-Shift-S* or the *Source* button.


# Comments

Any R code following a hash (``#``) is not executed.
These are called comments, and can and **should** be used to annotate and explain your code.
For example, this doesn't do anything.
```{r}
#thisisacomment
```
And in this, nothing after the ``#`` is executed,
```{r}
#this is still a comment
2 + 2 # this is also a comment
```


What is this equal to?
```{r}
5 * 4 # + 3 # - 8
```


# Getting Started

1. Create a new project.

    1. *File -> New Project*
    2. Select "New Directory"
    3. Select "Empty Project"
    4. Select a name for your project as Directory Name.
	   "POLS_503_Labs" is as good as any, and better than most.
       Then choose where to put this directory with "Create project as subdirectory of".
       Don't worry about the other options.

2. Creating your first R Markdown Document

    1. *File -> New File -> R Markdown*
    2. Choose a title and author for your file.  HTML output is fine. 
    3. Hit OK. This will open a template for your Markdown file. **Save this file now.**
    4. Cheatsheet and additional resources available at http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/

# Read In Data

In this example we will use data on gapminder

Download the 

```{r}
gapminder <- read.csv("gapminder.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

# Look at the Data
```{r}
gapminder
```

This is a lot of information. How can we get a more useful picture of the dataset as a whole?

```{r}
dim(gapminder) #This will show the dimensions of the dataframe. Row first, column second. 
names(gapminder)
head(gapminder)
summary(gapminder)

```

1. What are the variables in the dataset?
2. How many observations are there?
3. What types of data are the different variables?

## More on dataframes and variables
You can extract single variables (or columns) and perform different operations on them.
To extract a variable, we use the $:
```{r }
gapminder$lifeExp
```

Again, perhaps a summary may be more interesting. We can do more specific operations on this variable alone:

```{r}
mean(gapminder$lifeExp)
median(gapminder$lifeExp)
sd(gapminder$lifeExp)
min(gapminder$lifeExp)
max(gapminder$lifeExp)
```

Let's look at the distribution of the variable `lifeExp`. 

You will use the **ggplot2** package for graphics.
In order to use it, you will need to load it using `library()`
```{r}
library("ggplot2")
```


```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = lifeExp)) +
  geom_histogram()
```
We could also save the plot to a variable 
```{r}
lifexp_plot <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = lifeExp)) +
                      geom_histogram()
```
If you just write the variable it will print the object, which in this case creates the plot
```{r}
lifexp_plot
```

## Now explore another variable of your choosing

1. Look at some summary statistics for that variable.
2. Visualize the distribution of that variable with a histogram.
3. Describe this distribution in plain ordinary English to your partner.
4. Write it as discussion in your R Markdown file.

# Exploring relationships between variables

Facet the data by continent:
```{r}
lifexp_plot + facet_wrap( ~ continent)
```

1. Describe how the distribution varies across the continents (Write it in your Markdown!)

## Scatter GDP/LifeExp
## Add best fit & CIs

1. Write about the relationship.  

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(y = lifeExp, x = log(gdpPercap))) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + facet_wrap( ~ year)

library("dplyr")
gapminder1977 <- filter(gapminder, year == 1977)

ggplot(gapminder1977, )
```

## Getting Help with R

Refer to [Getting Help with R](getting

1. Refer to http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/ to find out how to create a density plot. Create a density plot of `gdpPercap`. Is is right skewed, left skewed, or symmetric? 
2. Go to stackoverlow and search for questions with tag `[r]`. 
    * What are featured questions today? 
    * What is the most voted question?
	* What is in the info tab?
3. Find and download the cowsay package. You cannot use `install.packages`. What does the `cowsay` function do? Run it with something fun (it'll make make sense once you know what it does).
