This course requires writing a final paper. Here are a couple of articles that may help.

- "Writing Empirical Papers: 6 Rules & 12 Recommendations", Christopher Adolph, <http://faculty.washington.edu/cadolph/503/papers.pdf>. Written for previous versions of 503 course and still applicable both to this course and beyond.

- Gary King, "Publication, Publication", <http://gking.harvard.edu/files/paperspub.pdf>. Advice on how to turn a class project into a publication.
