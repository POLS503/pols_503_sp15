I updated problem set 4 with the following:

- added code for calculating a `logit` transformation
- added instructions for installing **simcf**
- added example code using **simcf** functions to do simulations relevant to the problem set

Also, I've updated, corrected and expanded some the outliers and missing data imputation examples that I went through in class.

Next week, I'll be talking about limited dependent variables, and starting on causal inference.
For this week, I had assigned readings by Schrodt and Achen. It is unlikely that we will have time to talk about them in class, but I **suggest** that you read them, especially Schrodt's 7 Deadly Sins piece. It is a modern classic.
