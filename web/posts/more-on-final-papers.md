See the instructions [here](http://UW-POLS503.github.io/pols_503_sp15/posts/final-papers.html).
Additionally, here are a few clarifications.

- Your paper should be written in the form as an academic paper. Meaning, it should not be in the format of homeworks.

- Your can write your paper in whatever you want (LaTeX, Word, ...), but please turn it a pdf.
  Occassionaly, `.doc` files can have issues rendering correctly when opened in programs other than Microsoft Word, so it is safest to export them to a pdf.

- Turn in the code and data you used to run the analyses in your paper.
  These can be R markdown files or R scripts.
  Your analysis should run without errors.
  It is **very important** that you relate your code to the analyses in your paper.
  E.g. "this is the code used to create the models in Table 1 ...".

- If you are using Stata for some data cleaning, include the `.do` files.

- Explain what is in your analyses in a file named README.
  This file should explain what is in each of the other files, as well as brief instructions of how to run the analyses that you include.
  This can be brief, but should be written so that if (when) someone else wants to reproduce your analyses, they have sufficient instructions to be able to do so
  with the code and data you have provided.
