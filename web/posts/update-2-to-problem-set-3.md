A few notes on Problem Set 3:

On Problem 3 (Type I and II errors), it asks you to use $n = 1024$, but later says "using a smaller sample size, n = 32, and a larger sample size n = 1024.".
Use sample sizes of $n = 32$, $128$, and $1024$.
The purpose point is the look at how p-values and errors change with respect to sample size, and I wanted to give you a few values at which to analyze it.
But, the precise values of $n$ are not important, as long as you use enough values of $n$ to be able to see the pattern.

This does not change the problem, but I also added some plots to visualize how the values of $\gamma_1$ affect the heteroskedasticity in the regression.
