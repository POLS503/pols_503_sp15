After our discussion in lab, I've updated homework 3.

- Do not do Problem 7 (Truncated Dependent variable)
- Use iterations of 1024 in the simulations
- I added more code examples in all the problems.
- I removed extraneous printing of function source code that
  you do not need to know.

Let me know if you have any other questions.
