# R

## ggplot2

- The ggplot2 book. A new version just came out. You can find it on canvas.
- The ggplot2 documentation http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/. If you don't know the function you want click on something with a picture that looks like what you are looking for.
- Cookbook for R [graphs](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/). The author now works for Rstudio, infer from that what you will. It is organized by specific task so it may be easier to find what you are looking for than the documentation, which is arranged by 

## tidyr / dplyr

- [Data Wrangling Cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pd)f

## Markdown and R Markdown

- [R Markdown Cheat Sheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)
- [R Markdown Reference Guide](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf](http://www.rstudio.com/wp)

## Books

- [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net/)
- Jared Lander, [R for Everyone](http://www.amazon.com/Everyone-Advanced-Analytics-Graphics-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321888030) Teaches R assuming neither a programming or statistics background. One that I have considered and may consider in the future.
- Note that all books in the Springer UseR! Series are available as eBooks (the non-DRM downloadable pdf kind!) from the UW Library.

    - Peter Daalgard, *Introductory Statistics with R*
	- Robert Muenchen, *R for Stata Users*
	- Hadley Wickham, *ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis*. It's a litte out of date at this point, so trust the `ggplot2` documentation. But, a new version is coming out any day now.
	- Venables and Ripley, *Modern Applied Statistics with S*. A good reference book for both a variety of statistical models and how to implement them in R. 

- Need to level up your R skills?

    - Hadley Wickham, *Advanced R*. If you really want to know what R as a *language* is doing, this is now the place to start. Available free as in beer and freedom at http://adv-r.had.co.nz/, and as a physical copy published by [CRC](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1466586966/).
	- Hadley Wickham, *R packages*. If you want to write your own R package (and you should), start here. Available for free at http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/.
	- Norman Matloff, [The Art of R Programming](http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Programming-Statistical-Software/dp/1593273843)
	- Garrett Grolemund, *Hands-On Programming with R*, http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028574.do
    - Like Dante? Frustrated with R? [The R Inferno](http://www.burns-stat.com/documents/books/the-r-inferno/)

- Yihui Xie, *Dynamic Documents with R and knitr* http://www.amazon.com/Dynamic-Documents-knitr-Chapman-Series. The book about *knitr* from the author of *knitr*.
- An (almost) comprehensive bibliography of R books http://www.r-project.org/doc/bib/R-books.html. They leave out some of the books widely disliked in the R community or obsolete.
- Don't Bother

    - [R in a Nutshell](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596801717.do) Not for learning R. Okay as reference.
    - John Verzani, *Using R for Introductory Statistics*. This (formerly) appeared on many an stats syllabi (it's what I used in my equivalent of 503) and is decent, but the R code is poor and now woefully out of date.
	- Michael Crawley, *The R Book*. No, no, it's not.

# LaTeX

- Need to lookup a LaTeX symbol? Just draw it here: http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html
- Heres a couple of online LaTeX math equation editors: http://www.sciweavers.org/free-online-latex-equation-editor, http://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php They seem fine, but a good LaTeX friendly text editor will have better capabilities
