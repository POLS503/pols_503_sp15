## ggplot2

- The ggplot2 book.
- The ggplot2 documentation http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/. If you don't know the function you want click on something with a picture that looks like what you are looking for.
- Cookbook for R [graphs](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/). The author now works for Rstudio, infer from that what you will. It is organized by specific task so it may be easier to find what you are looking for than the documentation. This contains some of what is in the book, [R Graphics Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023135.do).

- [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net/)
- Jared Lander, [R for Everyone](http://www.amazon.com/Everyone-Advanced-Analytics-Graphics-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321888030) Teaches R assuming neither a programming or statistics background. One that I have considered and may consider in the future.
- Peter Daalgard, *Introductory Statistics with R*
- Robert Muenchen, *R for Stata Users*
- Venables and Ripley, *Modern Applied Statistics with S*. A good reference book for both a variety of statistical models and how to implement them in R. 

# LaTeX

- [Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX](https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf)
- [LaTeX Wikibook](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX)
- [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/) documentation. Although geared towards the ShareLaTeX online editor, it is also good user-friendly introduction to LaTeX if the ShareLaTeX specific stuff is ignored.
- Carolina Johnson's excellent LaTeX intro [pdf](http://staff.washington.edu/csjohns/503/WorkshopTemplate.pdf), [tex](http://staff.washington.edu/csjohns/503/WorkshopTemplate.tex)
- Using LaTeX. You should find a good LaTeX friendly 
    - [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/about): a not free, online editor for collaboration.
	- See <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TeX_editors>
	- Emacs or Vim. If you have to ask, you are not ready.

- Need to lookup a LaTeX symbol? Just draw it here: <http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html>
- Here's a couple of online LaTeX math equation editors: <http://www.sciweavers.org/free-online-latex-equation-editor>, <http://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php> They seem fine, but a good LaTeX friendly text editor will have better capabilities
