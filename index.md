# Overview and Class Goals

<!-- Begin from Chris Adolph syllabus -->

This course continues the graduate sequence in quantitative political methodology, focused particularly on fitting, interpreting, and refining the linear regression model.

Our agenda includes gaining familiarity with statistical programming via the popular R environment, developing clear and informative graphical representations of regression results, and understanding regression models in matrix form.

<!-- End from Chris Adolph syllabus -->

# Prerequisites

<!-- Begin from Chris Adolph syllabus -->

It is desirable for students to have taken the introductory course in the
sequence (Political Science 501), but any prior course on basic social statistics and linear regression should suffice.

<!-- End from Chris Adolph syllabus -->

# Assessment and Evaluation

Course evaluation is based on:

1. Problem sets assigned weekly or bi-weekly. These problem sets will include programming problems with an emphasis on writing understandable, reproducible code.
2. Final paper. A 15--20 page original report on an original quantitative analysis or replication-and-extension of a published article.
    The quantitative analysis should be conducted in R and reproducible.
	Students may work in pairs on the final paper with instructor permission.
