# Software

- Update simcf?
- Automatic plots of AVP or 1st diff?
- Average Predictive Comparisons function. Like `predcomp` but slightly different.

# Changes

- More on interpretation.
- Usability of simulation software needs to be improved.
  Either update simcf or move to Zelig.
- Need worked examples of data analysis from start to finish.
- Cover outliers before residual diagnostics.
  Not having covered the hat matrix comes up later in CV.
  Also, general purpose discussion of how regression weights observations.
- Did not discuss F-tests at all. Need to at least mention them even if not
  emphasizing statistical tests
- Consider not using the Fox textbook.
  Students do not like it.
