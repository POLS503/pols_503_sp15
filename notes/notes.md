# Labs

Lab document

- should be .Rmd, compile to
- Learning Objectives at the top
- Should it show solutions by default? If not, then it forces individuals to type in the solutions. Labs by Cetinkya-Rundel do not show results ([example](https://stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring15/sta101.001/post/labs/lab9.html)); Labs by Software carpentry do show results ([example](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/01-starting-with-data.html)).
- Follow advice from software carpentry templates

    - Software Carpentry Lesson Templates: http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2014/10/new-lesson-template-v2.html (the concepts, but not the details of implementation).

Conduct of the lab

- Follow the tips for teaching in Software Carpentry [here](http://swcarpentry.github.io/slideshows/teaching-tips/index.html) and [here](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2015/03/teaching-tips.html)

# R Stuff

- Minimal repdroducible example http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example

# Homework Assignments via Git

Want to do oneday, but that day is not today

- https://stat545-ubc.github.io/hw00_homework-guidelines.html

# Communication

- Stat 545 uses GitHub issues and twitter for all discussion. https://stat545-ubc.github.io/help-STAT545.html
  Are all students in github organization?

# Interactive Apps

- ShinyEd https://stat.duke.edu/~mc301/shinyed/ CLT, distribution calculator, diagnostics for a simple linear regression

# Stupid Stuff

- "Statistical significance? You keep using that phrase. I do not hink it means what you think it means" 
- "P-values. You keep using them. I do not think they mean what you think they mean" http://i.imgur.com/UuVWihM.jpg

## R Style Guides

- Largely follow the Data Camp https://teach.datacamp.com/style-guide style guide
- [Advanced](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)
- http://jefworks.github.io/R-style-guide/#naming-conventions

## Assessments

- Software carpentry in-lesson assessment http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2015/03/teaching-tips.html
    - Real time feedback using sticky notes. Learners post a red sticky when they need help. They take down
	  all notes at the start of exercises. They post a green sticky note when they have finished.
	- Students make little name tents out of red and green paper. Prop it up on red side or green side depending on whether the lesson is too fast or slow.
	- Minute notes. At lunch and at the end of the day learners write one good point (something they learned) and one bad point (something that didnt' work, that they didn't understand, or that they already knew).
    - Etherpad for notes and sharing
	
- Data Analysis and Statistics Data Camp Lab.
    - This lab covered material that is covered in the class (Strongly Agre, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly Disagree)
	- The lab improved my understanding of these topics.
    - The data were relevant and interesting to me.
    - The length of time took to complete lab. (Less than 30 min, 30 min to 1 hour, 1 hour and 2 hours, more than 2 hours)

## Pre- and Post-Survey

### Pre-Survey

- remove question on "linear algebra". Based on the responses I think some confused it with algebra.
- Add question about multiplying two matrices, transpose of a matrix, and matrix x vector.

# Misc

- coefficient plots: **arm**, **coefplot**, using **broom** to **ggplot2**
- tables: 
    * texreg: both html and latex. Issues getting the LaTeX to play nice with markdown
    * stargazer: both html and latex
	* comparison http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5465314/tools-for-making-latex-tables-in-r
    * http://conjugateprior.org/2013/10/call-them-what-you-will/, http://conjugateprior.org/2013/03/r-to-latex-packages-coverage/
