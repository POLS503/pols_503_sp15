# HW3

- Need to introduce the programming in class or lab the week before

# May 12

Overview

- Went over HW3.
- Covered some more of http://faculty.washington.edu/cadolph/503/topic5.pw.pdf
- Covered all of http://pols503.github.io/pols_503_sp15/lectures/Lecture_Model_Specification_handout.pdf
- Went over the [Life Expectancy Example](http://pols503.github.io/pols_503_sp15/docs/docs/Life_Expectancy_Example.html)
- Went to 7:20. Did not cover bootstrap. 

Questions

- What to do about missing data? 
- What is likelihood? There was confusion between the standard error of the coefficients and the standard error of the regression.
- Is there any point of AIC/BIC anymore instead of using CV
- Why x-fold cross-validation? What percentage of observations should be held-out for cross-validation.
- Will reviewers understand cross-validation? If not, how to justify its use, even if better.
- Does CV assume that the test dataset is representative of the training? I discussed issue with spatial, temporal, and stratified data.

Comments

- I hadn't covered first differences yet, let alone simulation. There were no actual slides on
- I'm still concerned that interpreting in regression has been overlooked.
- The class needs more applied examples.
- The slides needed many revisions; not good transitions, many typos.
- The usage of Rmarkdown documents is still awkward.
- Need to streamline my advice of model fitting. It was rambling and not coherent, even in light of a lack of coherence in model choice.
