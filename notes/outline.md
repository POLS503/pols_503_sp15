# Week 4

- ANOVA decomposition of regression: RSS, TSS, SEE.
- estimators of sigma
- Significance Testing

    - What is a confidence interval?
    - What is a p-value?
    - What they are not?

- Specific procedures for OLS

    - Individual coefficient tests
    - F test

- General arguments against P-values
- Statistical significance problems: 
- Type M errors: Even if the alternative hypothesis is correct, statistically significant results will overstate the magnitude. Especially if the size is small.
- Multiple testing problems: These are not accounted for.
- comparing two coeficients

    - Difference in p-values is not statistically significant.
    - Overlapping coefficients do not mean not statistically significantly different
