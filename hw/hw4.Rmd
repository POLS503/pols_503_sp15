TODO: go the typical route of data analysis. 

1. Analyze functional form of each variable with residuals
2. Compare models with out of sample testing.

# Instructions and Introduction

1. Create a new R project for this homework named `hw3` and load that project.
2. Do your analyses in an R markdown document based off of [hw3-template.Rmd](hw3-template.Rmd)
2. Download [hw3-functions.R](hw3-functions.R) and save in to your project directory.
3. Submit a zipped file of the directory with your R project through Canvas. This should contain all the materials for another person to run your R Markdown file  This should contain:

    - The R project (`.Rproj`) file
	  - The R Markdown document (`.Rmd`) of your analyses
	  - An HTML document (`.html`) compiled from your R Markdown document.
	  - Any data or other files needed to run the analyses in your R Markdown document.

4. Your R Markdown file should follow the guidance from [here](http://pols503.github.io/pols_503_sp15/r_markdown_assignments.html) and your R code should follow the guidelines [here](http://pols503.github.io/pols_503_sp15/r_best_practices.html).
5. Turn in a paper copy of the document compiled from the analyses at lab.
6. You can work together on this but you should each turn in your own assignments and write up your work separately.
   Include the names of your collaborators on your assignment.

## Showing Confidence

We revisit the sprinters data we considered in Problem Set 2.
a. Add confidence intervals to the plots you made for Problem Set 2, problem
1d. using the predict() command to generate the confidence intervals around
the expected finish times.
b. erun the analysis and recreate the plot, adding confidence intervals, for the
model:
log(Finishi) = β0 + β1Yeari + β2Womeni + β3Yeari × Womeni + εi
Be sure to explain in words how this specification differs from the one used in
part a.
c. erun the analysis and recreate the plot, adding confidence intervals, for the
model:
Finishi = β0 + β1Yeari + β2Womeni + β3Yeari × Womeni
+β4Year2
i + β5Year2
i × Womeni + εi
Be sure to explain in words how this specification differs from the ones used in
part a. and b.
d. Compare the visual fit of these models to the data within the observed period.
Which do you find plausible fits?
e. Do these models have different predictions for the Olympics of 2156? (Hint:
extending your plots to go up to 2156 is an easy way to see this.) Why or why
not?
f. Now create a new variable, the ratio of men’s time to women’s time in each
year. Logit-transform this variable and regress it on year. Plot the results, with
confidence intervals, on the scale of the ratio men’s time to women’s time (i.e.,
transform it back from logit). Does this approach make any assumptions about
men’s times or women’s times that might be problematic?

## Model Selection: Oil & Democracy

For this problem, we will use a cleaned-up version of the dataset employed by Michael
oss in ``Does Oil Hinder Democracy?'' World Politics, 2001. In that paper, we estimated a time series cross-section model of Polity scores regressed on oil exports and a battery of controls.
In this problem, we will focus on a single cross-section (saving the time series cross-section analysis for a later optional homework), and instead focus on model fitting and robustness to outliers.

A description of the included variables follows:
